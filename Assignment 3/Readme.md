# CMPE-258 Deep Learning Assignment 3

## Part A: 
Used pure Numpy to build a 3-layer neural network to train on data and picked appropriate number of neurons in each layer and used relu for non-linearity.

## Part B_1: 
Used pure pytorch tensor data structure to build the same without the auto differentiation.

## Part B_2:
Used pure pytorch tensor data structure to build the same but used auto differentiation this time.

## Part B_3:
Used pure pytorch linear modules etc., high level primitives and built the neural network.

## Part C_1:
Used pure tensorflow tensor data structure to build the same without the auto differentiation.

## Part C_2: 
Used pure tensorflow tensor data structure to build the same but used auto differentiation this time.

## Part C_3: 
Used pure tensorflow keras linear modules etc., high level primitives and built neural network.
